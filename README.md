Rust solutions for the Cryptopals Crypto Challenges (https://cryptopals.com). 

I'm using these challenges primarily to drive my understanding of the Rust programming language, but also to go deeper in a few of the security topics covered. If you see anything that looks incorrect, or stylistically problematic with my code, please cut an issue!
